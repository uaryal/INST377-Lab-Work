        <h1> Uday Aryal | Lab 1: Intro to HTML </h1>
        
        <h2> Welcome to my first Webpage!</h2>
        <p> Here are some fun facts about me:</p>

        <ul> 
            <li> I was born in Nepal, and speak Nepali, Hindi, and Urdu fluently. </li>
            <li> I work full time in commercial aerospace and civil aviation policy.</li>
            <li> I am very passionate about cryptocurrency, soccer, and making the best pesto from scratch.</li>
        </ul>

        <p> These are my favorite albums:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li> Illmatic by Nas (1996)</li>

        <h2> My First Interaction with HTML Beyond Inspect Element</h2>
        
        <p> The nickname my parents call me is <em> babu. </em></p>
        <p> It means <strong> baby</strong> in Nepal. </p>
        <p> It caught on so much that my <em><strong> friends call me that. </strong></em></p>

        <h2> Closing Regards </h2>
        <p> Looking forward to the class!
        <hr>
        Uday Aryal </p>
